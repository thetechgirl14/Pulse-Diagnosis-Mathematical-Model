# Pulse-Diagnosis-Mathematical-Model
Pulse Diagnosis Mathematical Model is based on the Ayurvedic approach of diagnosing an ailment by pulse. This model quantifies the changes in pulse signal taken at the fingertip, to determine if the subject is healthy or have ailments (Hyperthyroidism, Diabetes, Hypertension). Since the dataset was limited to only three ailments, this model classifies the subject in terms of only three ailments. The model was trained in machine learning, using various algorithms. Since, the data is highly non-linear, an Artificial Neural Network was chosen to be the best fit in the end. This Project was done as a Final Thesis for my Undergraduate program.
